## About the Statistics

Statistics are powered by [Github Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) stat by computing the total sum of an Asset Downloads for a specific Unofficial ACC Package. It works in a similar fashion as the [Github Release Stat Project](https://github.com/Somsubhra/github-release-stats).

As stated by [NPM in a post regarding stats](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/92574016600/numeric-precision-matters-how-npm-download-counts-work.html), "Use these numbers as directional indicators of package popularity. They are not absolute numbers, and they are definitely not the same as the number of 'users' of a package".
